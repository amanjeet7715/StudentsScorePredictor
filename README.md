# StudentsScorePredictorApp
This is a Students Score Predicting App.

Here, I have developed a simple Students Gate Score Predicting App which is using a Score Predictor api that provides us the Score details of any Student demanded by the user on the basis of the number of hours they study per day.

For Developing the project I have used Flask Framework as base. I have used HTML and CSS for developing basic structure of the project. All the coding part is implemented using Jupyter Notebook and Python Language.

# For using the project use the following commands :
  * $ git clone
  * $ set FLASK_APP= app.py
  * $ flask run
  
  The whole project is deployed on Heroku Cloud.

  Thank you!
